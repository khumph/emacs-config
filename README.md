This repository houses my emacs configuration files. I pretty much only use Emacs for the terrific [Org mode](https://orgmode.org), so there isn't anything fancy.

Everything you would need to recreate my configuration is here (provided you install the necessary Emacs packages) except for [sensible-defaults.el](https://github.com/hrs/sensible-defaults.el) which needs to be added to your .emacs.d driectory along with the files in this repository.
